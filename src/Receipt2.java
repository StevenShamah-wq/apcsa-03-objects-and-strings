/**
 * Exercise 5 (Homework) — Receipt, version 2
 *
 * Rebuild your Session 4 receipt, but this time:
 *   - Every price is stored in a variable
 *   - Every quantity is stored in a variable
 *   - Line totals are CALCULATED (price * quantity)
 *   - The grand total is CALCULATED (sum of line totals)
 *   - Nothing numeric is typed directly into the output string
 *
 * ⚠️ Watch your parentheses. "Total: " + price * qty will
 *    NOT do what you want if you get it wrong.
 *
 * Challenge: add an 8.875% sales tax line, rounded to 2 decimals.
